# BOOTCAMP WEEK 2 PROJECT - DOJO-ROOMS

# Introduction

When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space if they choose to opt in. When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only. This program randomizes a room allocation system for one of Andela Kenyaâ€™s facilities called The Dojo.

This is version 1 of this product and it has 5 core functions. 

# Create Room
   ```USAGE: create_room <room_type> <room_name>...```
